## Component guidelines

### Svelte Components

For Svelte components, please use the `.svelte` file extension. For any external props, please put them into a `<script module>`
block at the top of the file, and ensure they are exported as `{ComponentName}Props`, e.g. a `button.svelte` component should export a `ButtonProps` interface or type.
