# Chorus

Chorus is my attempt to build a code editor with Tauri and Svelte 5. It's still a work in progress, but I'm keeping it open source as I firmly believe
that open source work is critical to the role of software engineers.

This is going to be my biggest foray into Tauri and Rust, and there's a lot of things we need to do before we can get to 1.0. 

## Goals

I have been a VSCode user for many years, and I'm a huge fan of the editor. I've been using it for a long time, and I've been using it for my day job. However, I am also a frequent user of NeoVim/Vim. I appreciate the way I can move around my editor with Vim's keybindings, but I also miss the features of VSCode.

Chorus aims to be a code editor that can combine both of those things. I want a graphical user interface that is easy to use, but that can be navigated seemlessly with keybindings. I also want for as much of the base UI as possible to be customizable -- Supermaven, PearAI, and Hex should not have to build their own code editors to accomplish their features. 

I'm also aiming to have a couple of extensions that I like from NeoVim be viable in the main Chorus editor. 

## Roadmap

I don't really have one. I sort of bounce between ideas and projects. This has been my project lately, so I'm working on it as the enjoyment lands. Once I am more frustrated with this project, I will probably switch to another project I have (see my Github for a few projects I bounce to). I'll try to get something up on either the GitHub board or ClickUp for my "what 1.0 looks like" expectations.
